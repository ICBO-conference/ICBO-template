# ICBO Template
This repository is a template for creating ICBO conference repositories. To create a specific ICBO conference repository, see the [GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for how to create a repository from a template.

The template is set up to use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to configure a `github.io` website. The deployment of the website is controlled using the GitHub action `.github/workflows/build-deploy-documentation.yaml`. The GitHub action has been configured to run if any changes are made to mkdocs.yaml, files in the `docs/`, `docs/images/`, `docs/papers/`, `docs/slides/`, or `docs/flash-talks/` directories, or after a pull request is merged. Using pull requests allows you to closely track changes made to the repository (if desired). The [icbo2022 conference repository](https://github.com/ICBO-conference/icbo2022) is an example of how a repository can be configured using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Below are some general instructions for how to add and edit website content. Once your repository has been created, you are free to configure your ICBO repisitory as you desire. Any suggestions or contributions on how to make the instructions for (this) the template repository are welcome.
